    "The optical description of the sea state by the capillary wave statistics is a good approximation to nature particularly for seas freshly activated by winds. However it is to be expected that the optical properties of a fully developed sea, over which for long times and extensive fetches the wind has been active, may be affected by the presence of the resultance gravity waves. In particular, at low solar altitudes the effects of wave shielding may become important, since the incoming rays will tend to strike the frontsides of the large gravity waves while the backsides remain in shadow\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple hybrid wave model is possible that will combine capillary and gravity waves. We first construct the gravity wave swells over a rectangular grid using the air-water surface representations - this defines a set of gravity wave facets. The capillary hexagonal grid is then fitted to each gravity wave facet. Shielding by the gravity waves can be thought of  a change in the incoming ray direction relative to the capillary waves riding on the gravity wave facet. Thus when a ray strikes a gravity wave facet which is tilted toward the sun, the capillary waves on that facet see the sun as being \"higher\" in the sky relative to the plane of their gravity wave facet. \n",
